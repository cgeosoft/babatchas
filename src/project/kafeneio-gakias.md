- 'This project targeted a 1900’s building, initially run as a small, low-key tavern.
  In the course of time, a number of alterations were introduced to the pre-existing
  main area, expanding the building to its garden’s perimeter. A secondary room was
  further added to enlarge the sitting area, followed by a small kitchen, a storage
  room, a washing area, lavatories and connecting corridors. '
- 'Difficulties in the design emerged when attempted to turn this chaotic and unorthodox
  layout into a cohesive restaurant unit that could work well without secluding the
  remotely placed areas. The design concept aimed to bring to light those qualities
  that characterise traditional taverns in working class neighbourhoods, initially
  populated by immigrants. The challenge was to design a layout that would transform
  this complex of small rooms into an efficient restaurant area, that could serve
  daily around 200-300 customers. By moving the kitchen in the centre of the multiple
  little rooms, we created a web around it, where everyone would feel the heart of
  the business beating. This way, no room was left isolated, and the restaurant’s
  staff could work like a well-tempered clock. '
- The main room was maintained as the restaurant’s entrance and a large custom designed
  folding door was fitted to create the feel of traditional corner shops simulating
  a market, a coffee shop and a tavern at the same time. Hand painted furniture and
  ceilings were carefully treated with plaster to reproduce the look of the multiple
  layers of colour applied through the years. Marble worktops were added to the pantry
  area and a display fridge was introduced as the main counter. The traditional stove
  to make Greek coffee was framed up inside an arched niche. Marble tables and wooden
  chairs along with pieces of old furniture were used throughout the restaurant. Frames
  displaying photographs of the early 1900’s decorated the walls, along with porcelain
  fixtures. The ceiling was designed to remind of a coffered look in a simplistic
  form and recessed micro-spotlights were discreetly placed to avoid a glare effect.
- Enameled tableware and brown paper sheets, instead of tablecloths, completed the
  decoration conveying an overall old-fashioned and laid-back feel.
