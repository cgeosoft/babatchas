description:
- The owners of this stone-build residence located in the village of Agios Andreas
  in Arcadia Province, appointed BaΒatchas to design a holiday retreat, that could
  also work as the main residence. The aesthetic direction given was not to stir away
  from the traditional architecture of the area, but to incorporate the comforts of
  a city residence.  The premises had neither an impressive building structure, nor
  other elements to suggest a welcoming country house. Always guided by the power
  of natural materials, and inspired by traditional techniques, BaΒatchas decided
  to reveal the natural stone on the facades of the building. The stones that could
  not be revealed were treated with a local natural plaster technique named kourasani.
  The rough texture of the flat walls covered with kourasani, tacitly blend in with
  the unveiled stone walls. In the interior, the traditional layout, dictating the
  beds’ position, led us to preserve the adjoining walls in the main living area.
  A step lower, an alternative living space was introduced to allow a more comfortable
  sitting area. As both main areas were insufficient in terms of height, the decision
  to reveal the stone in the interior walls allowed a feeling of spaciousness and
  elevation.  Light weighted and light coloured textiles were introduced in the living
  area to evoke a contemporary breeze; cushions with traditional embroidery and artifacts
  were carefully placed to maintain the traditional spirit. In the restroom as well
  as in the kitchen area, the walls were also treated with kourasani, and coloured
  with natural techniques.  Marble antiques have been selected to fit in the enclosed
  garden of the premises in-keeping with the rural interior & exterior surroundings.
