  - Babatchas Design Studio is an interior design office located in Athens, Greece,
    specializing in the study of private residents, luxury accommodation and commercial
    spaces while at the same time creating design objects, custom made furniture and
    pieces of art. Chrysi Makri and Nefeli Gkyzi are the co-founders and creative directors
    of Babatchas Design Studio.
  - Chrysi is an interior architect with an over a decade experience in high end residential
    and hospitality projects around the world, as well as commercial ones. After a successful
    career in the UK, she returned to Greece to focus on five star hospitality projects
    in Greece and Asia.
  - Nefeli is an interior architect with a rigid background in large scale commercial
    projects in Germany where she gained an organized business profile as well as a
    management talent. She returned to her routes in Greece to get involved in luxury
    hospitality projects and residences.
  - Once their business routes had collided, their shared passion in interiors and art
    motivated them to create a collective where design ideas and forms could flourish
    and develop. Their shared vision is creating interiors that evoke emotions and remain
    honest and close to their context and location. Their shared love for their country’s
    tradition as well as Greece’s local grace and peculiarities has guided them towards
    reforming interior design suggestions that create a warm familiar feeling spiced
    up by a fresh and contemporary outtake.
