- Babatchas design studio began exploring the design of this building with outmost
  respect for its neoclassical architectural routes. With the determination to preserve,
  rethink and comply with the elements that define similar eclectic interiors, the
  goal was to make the minimum possible alterations to the existing building core.
  By decoding the main features of such neoclassical building, Babatchas set the principles
  to safeguard this monumental feeling oozing from the pours of such premises. The
  intention was to create ‘the climax of one’s route, though a sequence of exciting
  rooms’. Spaces of impressive height, with refined wall textures and ceiling finishing
  details, were revamped to address damages caused by previous renovations. Delicate
  drawn ceilings and walls have been revealed and restored in the hotel’s main entrance
  as well as in several guest rooms. Access to guess rooms was re-organized to re-orientate
  and diversify the existing layout to serve the daily routines of a hotel business.
- 'In other cases secret doors have been introduced to create a touch of mysticism.
  The client’s engagement with the design set certain boundaries; the already chosen
  name gave the direction of the overall design concept. '
- "‘Monsieur Didot’ owns its name to Firmin Didot, a man of letters and arts. This
  statement outlined the scheme of the interior design. Bookcases throughout the building,
  framed works by famous and infamous artists, portraits of influential people, handmade
  ceramics and custom designed lighting have been introduced into the building’s fabric,
  encouraging contrast, plurality of textures and shapes. The furnishings have been
  cared for by Babatchas design studio, and the vast majority has been custom-made. "
- 'Furnishings, combined with lighting fixtures and ceramic accessories have been
  designed to offer a boutique flavour and to serve the needs of a luxury hospitality
  establishment. ‘Monsieur Didot, the residence’ expresses the intended concept: a
  personalised hotel experience.'
