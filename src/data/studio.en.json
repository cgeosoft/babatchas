Chrysi Makri and Nefeli Gkyzi are the co-founders and creative directors of BaBatchas Design Studio.",
        "Chrysi is an interior architect with an over a decade experience in high end residential and hospitality projects around the world, as well as commercial ones. After a successful career in the UK, she returned to Greece to focus on five star hospitality projects in Greece and Asia.",
        "Nefeli is an interior architect with a rigid background in large scale commercial projects in Germany where she gained an organized business profile as well as a management talent. She returned to her routes in Greece to get involved in luxury hospitality projects and residences.",
        "Once their business routes had collided, their shared passion in interiors and art motivated them to create a collective where design ideas and forms could flourish and develop. Their shared vision is creating interiors that evoke emotions and remain honest and close to their context and location. Their shared love for their country’s tradition as well as Greece’s local grace and peculiarities has guided them towards reforming interior design suggestions that create a warm familiar feeling spiced up by a fresh and contemporary outtake."
